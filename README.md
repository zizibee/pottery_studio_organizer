# *My Personal Project:* Pottery Studio Organizer 

## Functionality ##
This application would keep track of pottery projects, 
documenting their title/creator, clay type, current clay stage, 
and the next step in production. Projects could be added and
removed to a collection of in-progress pieces that could be 
organized by clay type and status to group projects that can 
be fired together. Users would be able to select a project 
and get a status report listing its current stage and the 
next step to complete. Users could update a project's status 
after finishing a step. Once a project is complete, the piece 
would be added to a collection of completed works. Users could
view the lists of in-progress and completed pieces.
Users could choose whether to save their project collections 
and choose to load these projects from file.

## Users
This program could be used by:
- **Artists** - to keep track and organize their projects
- **Pottery teachers** - to keep track and complete students' 
projects
- **Studio owners** - to keep track of artists' projects and 
organize kiln firings

## Interest
This project is of interest to me because I have loved taking
ceramics courses in school but always wondered how my teachers
could organize and keep track of the many projects students 
were making and what pieces could be fired together. I am 
interested in creating an application that could make this 
process easier and could be of use to individual artists and 
studios too.
